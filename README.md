## Introduction

In computer science, data structures and algorithms are fundamental concepts that help organize and manipulate data efficiently. This repository provides Java implementations of several common data structures and algorithms, including but not limited to:

- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, etc.)
- Graphs
- Sorting Algorithms (e.g., Quick Sort, Merge Sort)
- Searching Algorithms (e.g., Binary Search)
- and more...

Feel free to explore the code, learn from it, and use it in your own projects.
